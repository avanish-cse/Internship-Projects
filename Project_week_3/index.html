          <h2>Lamborghini Revuelto</h2>
          <p>In the marque's 60th anniversary year, Automobili Lamborghini presented Revuelto, the first super sports V12 hybrid plug-in HPEV (High Performance Electrified Vehicle). Lamborghini Revuelto defines a new paradigm in terms of performance, sportiness and driving pleasure from its unprecedented new architecture; innovative design; maximum-efficiency aerodynamics; and a new carbon frame concept. An output of 1015 CV is delivered from the combined power of an entirely new combustion engine together with three electric motors, alongside a double-clutch gearbox that makes its debut on a 12-cylinder Lamborghini for the first time.</p>

        <div class="content" id="content2">
          <h2>Lamborghini Revuelto</h2>
          <p>The powertrain combines high specific power elements: the new 127 CV/liter combustion engine works synergically with two front axial flux motors that deliver an outstanding weight-to-power ratio, with a radial flux electric motor positioned above the first eight-speed double-clutch gearbox debuting on a 12-cylinder Lamborghini. The three electric motors are powered by a lithium-ion high specific power (4500 W/kg) battery pack that also supports a fully-electric drive mode.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content3">
          <h2>Lamborghini Revuelto</h2>
          <p>The new Lamborghini Revuelto combines these attributes to deliver performance figures at the peak of its segment: acceleration from 0-100 km/h in only 2.5 seconds and a top speed of more than 350 km/h. These numbers combine with its exceptional dynamism thanks to the introduction of electric torque vectoring, and four-wheel drive available also in fully-electric drive mode, ensuring the Revuelto super sports car expresses its amplified qualities both on track and in daily driving.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content4">
          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>Lamborghini Revuelto brings the future of Lamborghini design to the road today. It stays constant to the exclusive Lamborghini design DNA but establishes an entirely new stylistic language. It links with the iconic and legendary Lamborghini V12 cars of the past throughout the new shape, while the new proportions open the door towards the future.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content5">
          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>With the Revuelto, Lamborghini launches a new Space Race, ushering in a design language that adapts to the challenges imposed by electrification, and presaging the shapes and proportions of super sports cars of the near future. The design is inspired by aerospace elements, characterized by sculpted surfaces encompassed by two lines that start from the front and embrace the cabin and engine, tapering down to the hexagonal-shaped exhausts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content6">
          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>The roof combines more headroom with aesthetic qualities and specific aerodynamic functions. The recessed profile channels air to the rear wing but at the same time allows more headroom in the cabin for both the driver and passenger.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content7">
          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>The rear is a tribute to the hybrid V12. The fully-exposed longitudinal engine highlights the mechanical heart of the Revuelto, visually connecting it to the double hexagonal exhaust surmounted by the geometrically profiled wing, framed by headlamp clusters with the Y-shape light signatures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content8">
          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>The steering wheel was inspired by the racing world and the experience of the Essenza SCV12. The four rotors located on the spokes are used for selecting both the driving modes and the car's lifting system and rear wing tilt. The intuitive design of the cockpit and controls deliver a distinctive Lamborghini feeling: buttons are used to activate the turn signals and the launch control among other functions, while allowing the driver to maintain an optimal grip on the steering wheel at all times.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content9">
          <h2>Personalization</h2>
          <p>Lamborghini Revuelto is the production Lamborghini model that offers the most potential for personalization. In fact, 400 bodywork colors are offered together with many more personalization options at the client's disposal allowing the creation of an entirely individual super sports car. The sustainable sportiness of Revuelto does not stop at the technical specification of the plug-in hybrid: all the paints used are water based rather than solvent based.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content10">
          <h2>Personalization</h2>
          <p>The cabin is characterized by the presence of visible carbon fiber used on the dashboard, in the hexagonal air vents and to frame the dashboard and central vents. The upholstery combines fine leathers with the new ultralight Corsa-Tex fabric in DinamicaÂ® microfiber, made of recycled polyester via a water-based production process. The customer can customize the interior of his car by opting for a balanced mix of leather and Corsa-Tex, or favor one material depending on his preference, with 70 color options available.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content11">
          <h2>Aerodynamics</h2>
          <p>Function and style share a singular mission on the Lamborghini Revuelto: aerodynamic efficiency. The new layout of the super sports car has different design requirements compared to the Aventador, which influenced the car's aerodynamic development. The development was based on four pillars: efficiency; synergy between the components; integration between the components; and design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content12">
          <h2>Aerodynamics</h2>
          <p>Optimum efficiency was achieved by combining high downforce and minimized drag. One of the key elements in this strategy is the new active rear wing, created to ensure the best aerodynamic performance in all driving conditions. For this reason, entirely new actuators have been developed, managing the load optimally in every situation thanks to three different settings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content13">
          <h2>Aerodynamics</h2>
          <p>The position of the wing changes according to the driving mode and dynamics, or it can be changed manually by the driver according to his or her preferences using the dedicated rotor on the steering wheel. The "closed" position (low drag) ensures minimum resistance, for example when driving in electric mode. This position is also the most suitable for fuel economy. It improves top speed values while still ensuring stability. The "high downforce position" on the other hand, maximizes downforce by optimizing the agility and handling of the Revuelto.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content14">
          <h2>Monofusolage</h2>
          <p>The monofuselage represents a significant step forward from the Aventador in terms of torsional stiffness, lightweight qualities and driving dynamics. What's more, the Revuelto is the first super sports car to be fitted with a 100% carbon fiber front structure: carbon fiber is also used for the front cone structures to ensure a level of energy absorption that is significantly higher when compared to a traditional metal structure - double that of the Aventador's aluminium front frame - combined with a substantial reduction in weight.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="content15">
          <h2>Absolute driving experience</h2>
          <p>Lamborghini Revuelto has been designed and developed to deliver absolute excitement and control in all situations and in all grip conditions, providing the driver with a level of confidence and connection with the car never experienced before.
          
          The innovations that place the Revuelto at the apex of its category include the architecture and balance of the car; the cutting-edge approach to the chassis and the aerodynamic design; and the new hybrid powertrain that makes it possible to maximize the electric motor support and introduce new driving modes, including electric 4WD, for a total of 13 different driving experiences.</p>
